UPDATES:

I'm adding an article from the beginning of '24, sharing some of my personal practices from the past year: [A "Health Blogger's" 2023 Summary](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/675470252).

Given that the article is quite long and many people may not have the patience to read it all, I have also recorded a [video version](https://www.bilibili.com/video/BV1EW4y1R7yi/) that covers most of the content in the article.

Additionally, for practicing a healthy lifestyle, I'm providing a minimalist basic list for your reference:

- Maintain sleep duration and quality.
- Do not smoke.
- Try to get some exercise every day.
- Reduce sugar intake.

By achieving these four points, you can already reach a pretty good state of health. The rest can be adjusted and supplemented based on your individual body condition.

# Background

Last May, I wrote an article introducing [Lex Fridman's daily routine](https://zhuanlan.zhihu.com/p/371254789). Subsequently, I made a series of adjustments and improvements to my own daily life based on his methods. The results over the past year have been quite remarkable, and I will share some of my practices and the tools I used at the end of this article.

A few months ago, I stumbled upon a [podcast on YouTube where Rich Roll interviews Andrew Huberman](https://youtu.be/2ekdc6jCu2E). It introduced the neuroscience principles behind improving our daily work and study performance, along with "tools" we can use. It instantly opened up a whole new world for me. I then binge-watched several more episodes of Huberman's own podcast, learning about various aspects of our daily life, health, learning, work, and exercise. The biggest difference between this and many other articles and videos about "wellness" is that Huberman is a professor of neuroscience at Stanford. The content he discusses is **all derived from high-quality, peer-reviewed scientific research**. Starting from the principles of how the body works, he meticulously explains the relevant experiments and conclusions, and provides a lot of practical advice (much of which is zero-cost, not a sales pitch...).

Through this series of learning, I gradually felt like I was learning the "composition and operating principles" of human beings. Through a series of tools and practices, we can **"tune" our own human system just like optimizing a software program**. This article will introduce some of this related knowledge. Note that the original podcast contains many professional explanations, which have been mostly removed in this article. I've tried to use a narrative style to make it easier to understand. Of course, this will reduce the accuracy, so if you want more professional content, I highly recommend watching the [original podcast content](https://hubermanlab.com/).

# Sleep

If you want to be healthy, have a better state for work and study, and improve your physiological health (like immunity and metabolism) and mental health (like better mood and focus), the most important prerequisite is good sleep.

## Principles

The most important mechanism controlling sleep is our internal biological clock. Influenced by this clock, various chemicals in our body change, our body temperature changes accordingly, affecting our various internal states and external behaviors. Professor Huberman vividly describes how this "biological clock" works: In the morning, the release of cortisol and adrenaline wakes us up and also sets a countdown timer in the pineal gland for the release of melatonin, which will make us feel sleepy more than ten hours later.

The biggest factor affecting this biological clock is light exposure. Besides seeing things, another major function of our eyes is to **receive light information through melanopsin ganglion cells to set our internal biological clock**. This is why sometimes after working all night, even though we haven't slept for a long time, as the sun rises, our biological clock is set to a state similar to waking up, and the release of various chemicals suddenly makes us feel energetic1 again. Many of the best practices that follow are related to this principle: we need to control the timing, type, and duration of our light exposure.

In addition, **body temperature is also a means of controlling our biological clock**. Generally, our body temperature gradually2 rises from a low state during deep sleep and continues to rise after waking up. It starts to gradually decrease in the latter half of the day until we fall asleep again.

## Practices

Based on the principles above, Professor Huberman provides a series of best practices to improve sleep:

- The release of cortisol is related to sun exposure. Therefore, if you want to wake up as quickly as possible and maintain good mental state during the day, you should **go outside and get some sun for 2-10 minutes after waking up**. This is very beneficial for blood pressure control, mental state, setting the sleep "countdown clock," etc. Outdoor sunlight is best. If using artificial light, blue light is better, and it's best if the light source is from above (the position of the sky). It's estimated that the intensity of sunlight received through a window is reduced by more than 50%, and the time required to achieve the same effect would be 50 to 100 times longer. Interestingly, this is also effective for visually impaired people, because the aforementioned melanopsin ganglion cells are not used for visual imaging.
- Correspondingly, **try to reduce light exposure at night**, as this will disrupt our biological clock, making the body system mistake it for daytime. Especially receiving light between 11 PM and 4 AM will inhibit the release of dopamine in the following days, affecting mood, mental health, concentration, learning ability, metabolism, etc. The role and mechanism of dopamine will be discussed separately later.
- If it's unavoidable to be exposed to light at night, a dim red light, candles, or light from a lower position is relatively better. If you have to look at a computer, it is recommended to use blue blockers, which may have a similar effect to software that automatically adjusts the screen's color temperature.
- Watching the sunset in the evening also helps with falling asleep later and can even reduce the negative effects of light exposure at night, which is a bit magical.
- A person's mental state generally has a brief dip in the middle of the day, so a nap may be helpful for some people. You can also use other non-sleep deep rest methods to replace it, such as [Yoga Nidra](https://youtu.be/M0u9GST_j3s), [Meditation](https://www.headspace.com/), [Self-hypnosis](https://www.youtube.com/c/MichaelSealey) (you can use apps like Reveri), etc.
- The effect of body temperature on the circadian cycle:
    - Taking a cold shower in the morning will cause a rapid increase in body temperature, thereby shifting the sleep cycle forward (waking up earlier).
    - Exercising at night will keep the body temperature high, thus delaying the cycle (going to bed later).
    - You can purchase smart mattresses that automatically control body temperature to improve sleep quality.
- The generally recommended exercise times are: 30 minutes, 3 hours, and 11 hours after waking up. However, the overall impact seems to be relatively small.
- Dietary and drug factors:
    - Caffeine occupies adenosine receptors, blocking the signal to fall asleep. Many articles mention avoiding coffee after noon, but Huberman says there are no scientific experiments showing that caffeine has the same effect on everyone; you have to test it for yourself. For example, he can drink coffee at 5 PM and still fall asleep normally.
    - Magnesium can help with falling asleep.
    - Apigenin can also help with sleep, but be aware of its effect on estrogen.
    - It is recommended not to consume too much taurine.
    - It is not recommended to take melatonin to help with sleep. The specifications of melatonin drugs are not strictly controlled, and melatonin3 can easily cause depressive moods.
    - For lunch, you can eat low-calorie foods and foods containing tyrosine, such as nuts, soybeans, and some vegetables, to increase dopamine and adrenaline and stay awake.
    - In the evening, you can eat some starches and white meat, which are rich in tryptophan. This is converted into serotonin, which makes you calmer and helps you fall asleep.
- For most people, 6-8 hours of sleep is relatively healthy.
- For information on various supplements, you can refer to: [examine.com](https://examine.com/).

# Diet

In Lex's previous sharing, he mentioned that he adopted a ketogenic diet and the habit of fasting, which drew my attention to eating habits. Professor Huberman also has several podcasts on fasting, gut health, and other topics, which are very interesting.

## Background of Fasting

We can divide the body's chemical states related to eating into two categories:

1. The fed state, which is a state of high blood sugar. At this time, our body is more active in cell replication and growth.
2. The fasting state, which is a state of low blood sugar. At this time, our body is more active in cell repair and cleaning (autophagy).

Since we naturally don't eat while sleeping, part of our sleep time puts us in a fasting state. The choice of eating times is actually about controlling the duration and balance of the two states mentioned above. What's interesting is that many cultures and religions around the world have customs related to fasting, sometimes for many days.

In 2012, scientists began experimenting with mice, dividing them into two large groups. One group could eat at any time of the day, while the other could only eat within a fixed 8-hour window. Within these large groups, subgroups were created, feeding the mice either healthy or unhealthy food. The results showed that the mice that could only eat within an 8-hour window, even if they ate unhealthy high-fat food, still maintained or even improved their health levels, showing significant improvements compared to all the unrestricted groups.

This study shook the academic world. Subsequently, many more experiments and papers were published on humans of different genders, ages, and occupations (including athletes). Scientists found that this **intermittent fasting state has many benefits for the body**, including: promoting liver health, bile acid metabolism, self-healing of inflammation, maintaining weight, increasing brown fat reserves (beneficial for health), preventing non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, blood sugar control, gut health, etc. If you develop the habit of intermittent fasting for more than 60 days, it will also make your body tend to metabolize fat for energy, helping with weight control.

Therefore, Professor Huberman points out that **when you eat is just as important as what you eat**. This research has also led many academic researchers, including Huberman himself, to adopt the habit of fasting.

## Practice of Fasting

Due to the difficulty of long-term fasting, most research focuses on intermittent fasting. In simple terms, it's the practice of eating within a fixed time window each day (aligned with the sleep cycle), just like the mice in the experiment, and not consuming any food at other times. Here is a summary of the basic and advanced versions:

- **Basic:** If you want to enjoy the basic benefits of fasting, the simplest principle to follow is **do not eat for at least 1 hour after waking up, and do not eat anything for 2-3 hours before bed**.
- **Advanced:** The **most ideal eating window according to current research is 8 hours**. Combined with social customs, a more reasonable time is in the range of 10 AM-6 PM or 12 PM-8 PM. It seems that **skipping breakfast is not a bad thing** :)
- The author kindly reminds that if you want to build muscle through fitness, it's recommended to shift this time window earlier, because protein intake in the morning is beneficial for muscle growth. You can choose your workout time freely.
- **Maintaining the stability of this window is also very important**. Otherwise, it's like frequent jet lag, which will significantly discount the benefits.
- If you want to try advanced fasting, it's recommended to gradually switch your eating habits, for example, by shortening the eating window by 1 hour every two days, gradually reaching the ideal 8 hours.

It's worth noting that "not eating anything" here doesn't mean you can't even drink water. As seen from the background above, whether you are in a fasting state mainly depends on your blood sugar level, therefore:

- Drinking water, tea, coffee (without milk) will not break the fast. But a spoonful of sugar will.
- To enter the fasting state as soon as possible after dinner, you can do some light exercise, like walking, to speed up blood sugar clearance.
- Metformin, berberine, etc., can directly promote blood sugar clearance. Cinnamon bark and lemon juice can also slightly lower blood sugar.

Finally, if you feel dizzy or shaky during a fast, you don't need to eat or consume sugar immediately. You can drink a little salt water (with lemon juice), which can usually relieve the symptoms well. This reminds me of Lex mentioning that he takes pills to supplement various electrolytes, such as sodium, magnesium, and potassium.

## Diet and Digestive Health

Since my own gastrointestinal function is relatively poor, I paid special attention to the topic of digestive health. Huberman invited a very well-known microbiologist, Sonnenburg, to talk about the relationship between gut microbiota and our health, and I learned a lot of new knowledge:

- The gut microbiota not only affects the healthy functioning of the digestive system but also **plays a very critical role in the human immune system**.
- The way babies are born and grow up forms very different gut microbiota ecologies. Exposure to microbial environments (but be careful of situations that can cause diseases) is beneficial for maintaining the microbial environment, such as having pets at home, letting children play freely, and not over-cleaning and disinfecting.
- What constitutes a healthy gut microbiota ecology currently has no standard conclusion. However, in general, **a high degree of diversity in the microbiota usually indicates better health**.
- Antibiotics can severely damage the gut microbiota ecology and should be used with caution.

In the interview, they focused on an experiment about what kind of diet can better maintain the diversity and health of our gut microbiota. The experiment mainly compared two supplementary diets:

- **High-fiber foods:** whole grains, legumes, vegetables, nuts. These are traditionally considered very healthy foods, and the breakdown of many of these fibers requires the help of the gut microbiota. In other words, fiber is their "food."
- **Fermented foods:** yogurt, kefir, kombucha, sauerkraut, kimchi, natto, etc. Note that they need to be naturally fermented, usually refrigerated and not canned. Also, for things like yogurt, be especially careful not to add sugar or other additives.

The results of the experiment were also quite surprising:

- The group that consumed fermented foods significantly increased the diversity of their gut microbiota. The subjects showed a **significant reduction in dozens of immune markers and had better suppression of various inflammations**. It's unexpected, but the gut microbiota can regulate inflammation.
- For people whose gut microbiota was already highly diverse, consuming high-fiber foods was helpful. If not, the help from high-fiber foods was not significant. In the process of industrialization, human eating habits have shifted to consuming large amounts of meat, processed foods, etc., for many generations, and the ecology of the gut microbiota cannot be changed simply by increasing the amount of fiber.

Additionally, in the interview, they discussed specific recipe recommendations, citing [Christopher Gardner's research comparing ketogenic and Mediterranean diets](https://youtu.be/sJLK3sVexIk). Here's a summary of the practical advice:

- **To improve the gut microbiota ecology, the best way is to consume naturally fermented foods twice a day**.
- High-fiber foods are beneficial for maintaining the gut microbiota ecology. It's recommended to have a diet based on plant-based foods, avoid highly processed foods, and control sugar intake. Professor Sonnenburg also told a story that at conferences attended by microbiologists, the salad bar is always in high demand :) Rich Roll, mentioned earlier, is also a vegetarian.
- **The effectiveness of probiotics is not supported by extensive research**, and the regulation of such products is limited. **The effects of prebiotics are also mixed**, with issues like lack of diversity and dissolving too quickly making the overall effect questionable.
- The Mediterranean diet has similar health effects to the ketogenic diet but is easier to follow. In addition, long-term practice of the ketogenic diet may have certain risks. So, **the Mediterranean diet is generally more recommended**.

Also worth referencing is our official [Dietary Guidelines for Chinese Residents](https://sspai.com/post/72984), which may be more suitable for the dietary habits of people in the East.

# Mindset and Motivation

This part mainly introduces the principles of the human dopamine system and how to use it to form a healthy, self-disciplined lifestyle. This episode is the most-watched one since Huberman started his podcast and provides excellent guidance for strengthening our minds.

## Principles

Dopamine is a very important chemical that mainly acts on two neural circuits: one affects body movement, for example, Parkinson's disease is related to insufficient dopamine secretion; the other affects our motivation, desire, and pleasure, which is related to almost all activities we engage in, whether it's work, study, socializing, or leisure. Here we will mainly discuss the latter effect of dopamine. Why do we "give up"? It's because under the influence of emotions like anxiety, stress, and frustration, the level of norepinephrine in the body continues to rise. When it exceeds a certain threshold, the cognitive control in the nervous system shuts down, and we give up. Dopamine can inhibit the effect of norepinephrine, thus continuously "motivating" us to move forward.

The level of dopamine in the nervous system affects our mood. When the dopamine level is low, we feel down and unmotivated, and when the dopamine level is high, we feel excited and happy. Under normal circumstances, our body is in a dopamine baseline state. When we achieve some exciting goals (like winning a game or getting a high score on a test), the dopamine level will reach a peak, and we will experience great pleasure. After the peak, the dopamine level will drop to a level lower than the baseline, and this state will last for a period of time.

There are two very important principles here:

- The absolute level of dopamine is only one aspect; **more important is its "relative change"**. For example, when you see an interesting video while scrolling through TikTok, your dopamine level rises, and you feel happy. When you scroll to the next video, the happiness you feel doesn't seem as strong because your dopamine is already at a relatively high level, making it difficult to create a larger change. But if you saw the same video a few days later, you might find it much more interesting. So, **when you continuously do something you like, the threshold for feeling pleasure will also continue to rise**.
- **The overall "reserve" of dopamine is limited!** This means that whether you get pleasure from learning, working, entertainment, socializing, exercising, or other ways, the "pleasure currency" you consume is the same: dopamine. Let's look at a few examples of the impact of this principle:
    - Many self-disciplined people say they have a "work hard, play hard" lifestyle. For example, they get a sense of accomplishment and satisfaction from high-intensity work on weekdays, and get pleasure from various leisure activities, sports, and socializing on weekends. In fact, they are all releasing dopamine to get pleasure. Over the long term, our body's dopamine baseline will gradually decrease, leading to a feeling of burnout, and we may lose our previous interest and energy in many things.
    - Many people are addicted to playing video games because they can provide a huge dopamine release and make people feel happy. But be aware that the reserve of dopamine is limited. If you become addicted to it, your dopamine depletion problem will become very serious: on the one hand, the things that can arouse your interest will become fewer, and perhaps only playing games can bring you happiness; on the other hand, it may even lead to a situation where playing games itself can no longer trigger the release of dopamine, causing serious depression problems.

In addition, **dopamine also has a stacking effect**. For example, if you like to work out, then exercise will stimulate the release of dopamine. And when we actually go to work out, we may unconsciously arrange many other "pleasure factors," such as choosing a day when we are in a good mental state, drinking some energy drinks before exercising, going with friends, socializing while working out, listening to some of our favorite music or podcasts, etc. These factors will also promote the release of dopamine, making you feel "unprecedentedly happy." But be aware of the principle mentioned earlier: the higher the dopamine peak, the longer the subsequent trough will be, and in the long run, it may reduce your ability to get pleasure from exercise alone. There are many such examples, such as eating with friends while playing on your phone and posting photos on social media. You can calculate how many pleasure factors are stacked :)

## External Factors Affecting Dopamine

Let's look at the specific factors that affect the release of dopamine. First, those that promote dopamine secretion:

- Chocolate, increases dopamine to 1.5 times the baseline
- Sex, increases to 2 times
- Nicotine, increases to 2.5 times
- Cocaine, increases to 2.5 times
- Amphetamine, increases to 10 times
- Caffeine itself only slightly increases dopamine, but it inhibits some dopamine receptors, enhancing the feeling from the same amount of dopamine.
- Yerba mate, contains caffeine, can control blood sugar, and also protects dopamine neurons.
- Mucuna pruriens can also increase dopamine (basically equivalent to L-DOPA), and can also increase sperm count and quality in men.
- Exercise is subjective; for people who like to run, it can increase dopamine to 2 times the baseline.
- Healthy social relationships also promote dopamine release.

In terms of food, Professor Huberman seems to **highly recommend Yerba Mate**.

There are also many drugs that increase dopamine release or affect its effects:

- L-Tyrosine, increases dopamine
- Phenethylamine (PEA), also found in chocolate, can increase dopamine
- Huperzine A, increases dopamine
- Various "smart drugs," such as Adderall, Modafinil, Alpha-GPC, Ginkgo, etc. Many students studying abroad should have heard of them.

Generally speaking, **it is not recommended to use these drugs continuously**, because the peak after dopamine release will cause a decrease in the baseline level, leading to an inability to enjoy activities, inability to concentrate, and limiting learning ability and neuronal plasticity. Huberman says that **a frequency of once a week should be safe**.

Finally, there is a rather special study: **cold water immersion can increase dopamine release to about 2.5 times the baseline**, and the duration is longer, reaching about 3 hours. It is recommended to use water at a temperature of 10-14 degrees Celsius, and pay attention to safety. In addition, cold water immersion does not need to be too frequent, about 11 minutes per week is enough. If you are already used to cold water immersion, then it will no longer have the effect of releasing dopamine.

There are also some factors that will reduce dopamine, such as:

- **Melatonin will cause a decrease in dopamine**. It was mentioned earlier that it is not recommended to use melatonin to help with sleep or to adapt to jet lag.
- Exposure to light during sleep will also cause a decrease in dopamine levels for the next few days. **Scrolling on your phone when you can't sleep in the middle of the night is very harmful**.

## Maintaining a Healthy Dopamine Level

After understanding the principles and various influencing factors, let's look at how to effectively design our life and work style to maintain a healthy and sustainable dopamine level.

To briefly review, we already know that dopamine reserves are limited, and getting addicted to one thing will continuously raise the threshold for feeling pleasure. So how can we maintain a long-term interest and commitment to something without depleting our dopamine? A classic example is how casinos operate. We don't win every time we bet. Winning occasionally releases dopamine, and it fluctuates up and down depending on how much money is won. This attracts players to continue participating. This is a very effective **intermittent and random reward mechanism**. I feel that many games and social network products have also adopted this idea in their design.

For activities we need to engage in frequently, we can also simulate this mechanism. Remember the **dopamine stacking effect** mentioned earlier? We can **achieve variations in dopamine release by randomizing the number of stacking factors**. Taking fitness as an example again, we can randomly decide whether to listen to music today, whether to bring a phone to the gym, whether to drink an energy drink before working out, etc. If we do nothing else and just work out, the amount of dopamine released will be relatively low. In this way, we can simulate a random reward mechanism with high and low dopamine releases.

## Growth Mindset

Finally, let's look at how to build a good mindset to use the dopamine system to improve ourselves.

There is a very well-known experiment where a group of children who naturally love to draw were given some rewards after they finished their paintings. After these rewards were removed, the children's interest and motivation in drawing greatly decreased. This experiment shows that when we receive rewards (such as money, delicious food, etc.) for an activity, we **actually reduce the pleasure of the activity itself**. Moreover, dopamine itself affects our perception of time and our emotional state. If we **always aim for the reward after completing the activity, very little dopamine will be released during the process, making the originally difficult process even harder to persist in**.

If you think about it carefully, this is a very interesting observation. Dopamine is a bit like our "instinct system," determining whether we are motivated to do something. But on the other hand, **our subjective thoughts can influence the way this system works**. This is perhaps why humans can break away from animal instincts and achieve many things that require "counter-intuitive" effort. The experiment mentioned above is an example of the negative effect of our subjective thoughts. We can naturally achieve a positive effect, which is a growth mindset.

Specifically, it's about **using self-suggestion to treat the process of effort itself as a "reward"**. The idea that "I am working hard, and this process itself is interesting and will make me stronger" will stimulate the body to release dopamine during the process. The increase in dopamine improves our mood and motivation, which also makes the difficulties encountered in the process of effort relatively easier to overcome. Focus on the process itself, rather than seeking various external stimuli before the process (such as the drugs mentioned earlier) or giving yourself a huge reward after the process.

This way of thinking seems very subjective, but this is how our nervous system works. Although the "hardware system" of humans is similar, the "software" that runs on it, such as knowledge and thinking, can be vastly different. **We can change our preferences for various activities through self-discipline and self-suggestion**. For example, by suggesting the health benefits of fasting to ourselves to gain satisfaction, rather than relying on a big feast after the fast. By using self-discipline to resist the attraction of high-oil and high-salt foods, and self-suggesting the benefits of plant-based foods for the body, after a period of persistence, you will find that even broccoli is quite delicious. This is also why we have introduced many principles in this article, not just behavioral suggestions. Because these principles can help us make better self-suggestions :)

The dopamine system also has operating mechanisms that "hinder" our cognitive growth. For example, when the information we receive supports our previous beliefs, it can also stimulate the release of dopamine and make us feel happy, which will essentially change our perception of the world. From this, it can be seen what a rare quality an "empty cup mentality" is. A large part of the reason why so many debates on the internet cannot reach a consensus can be "attributed" to this. How to overcome this kind of defect in the nervous system? One possible method is to regulate your emotions as much as possible to be in a calm state (increase serotonin levels), so that you can better listen to and absorb information that is inconsistent with your own cognition, and cooperate better.

This episode of the podcast had a huge impact on me personally. I highly recommend that everyone watch this episode on [Mindset & Drive](https://hubermanlab.com/controlling-your-dopamine-for-motivation-focus-and-satisfaction/). I believe you will also have different takeaways.

# Learning and Focus

Building on our understanding of the dopamine mechanism, we can continue to explore topics related to brain health, focus, and how to learn efficiently.

## Principles of Learning

From the perspective of neuroscience, the essence of learning is the rewiring of neurons. Furthermore, it requires the brain to be in a chemical state of learning, which Huberman often refers to as the neuroplasticity state. To achieve this state of neuroplasticity, there are two important conditions: one is sufficient focus, and the other is the signal of "making a mistake" (which will be expanded on later). Another interesting mechanism of the brain is that in the neuroplasticity state during learning, acetylcholine marks the neurons that need to be changed, while the actual neuron rewiring mainly occurs during rest and sleep. Isn't this a bit like the garbage collection mechanism of a JVM virtual machine? :)

What is an error signal? When we try to do something but fail to achieve the expected goal, the body sends a signal to the brain, "I made a mistake." In this cognitive state of making mistakes and being frustrated, the nervous system releases adrenaline (to increase alertness), acetylcholine (to increase focus), and dopamine (to promote neuron change and rewiring), which activates the plasticity of neurons. That is to say, **making mistakes is an important prerequisite for us to enter a learning state**. Students of machine learning should be very familiar with this; isn't this exactly the same as how we train models? :) In addition, many people may think that the flow state is the best state for learning, but Huberman doesn't think so. **The flow state is a state of high concentration and near-automation, where we are doing things we already know how to do, not learning new knowledge and skills**.

Regarding this learning state, a classic experiment is to have people wear glasses that can change the angle of vision and then perform tasks like grabbing objects. Because what is seen is shifted from its original position by the glasses, there will always be deviations in the grabbing motion at the beginning. But later, after entering a state of neuroplasticity, we can gradually adapt to the relevant visual shift, coordinate our hearing, movements, etc., to work together, and successfully complete the task. What's more interesting is that **this chemical state of "neuroplasticity" can be sustained**. We can even trigger this mechanism in the brain through some other operations first, and then go on to do the actual learning to speed up the learning process. There is also a hidden logic here: when you encounter setbacks and difficulties, your brain enters a plastic state, but if you give up at this time, **the neurons will also rewire to this pattern of easily giving up, forming a vicious cycle**.

The brain's natural neuroplasticity is better in young people and will greatly decrease after the age of 25. We will mention how to overcome this later.

In addition, **a large amount of neuron rewiring also occurs during rest and sleep**. This is also what we mentioned earlier: high-quality sleep is a prerequisite for achieving many physiological and psychological strengths.

## Utilizing Neuroplasticity

If you are reading this article and are not yet 25 years old, congratulations, your neuroplasticity is still very good. You can **learn as wide a range of knowledge and skills as possible**. For example, you can quickly learn various musical instruments, new languages, new sports, new professional skills, etc. Through a broader range of experiences, try to find the direction you are most interested in, and then you can continue to deepen it later.

If you are already over 25 like me, there are still many ways to improve neuroplasticity:

- Experiments have found that **adults can fully adapt and master small incremental learning**. For example, if the visual deviation is only 7 degrees each time, instead of a 180-degree reversal all at once, adults can also quickly learn and correct from mistakes. Applied to actual learning, we can control the amount of content we learn each time to not be too much (this article is a bit of a violation, it is recommended to save it and learn slowly), and accumulate multiple times to complete the adjustment and learning of the nervous system.
- The higher the desire to achieve a goal, the greater the importance, and the greater the stimulation of the reward (e.g., for survival), the more likely neuroplasticity will occur. This is more intuitive, but may not be very practical in reality.
- The third point is the most interesting: **by disrupting the vestibular system, you can achieve a state of neuronal plasticity**. Simply put, it's about giving your body some "novel gravitational experiences," such as handstands, yoga, gymnastics, skateboarding, or any state that makes your body lose balance. This will quickly trigger the signal "I made a mistake," entering a learning state, and you can even go on to learn other tasks afterward. This immediately reminded me of **the "handstand culture" in the early days of Taobao; I didn't expect it to have a scientific basis**. It should be noted that this experience must be novel. That is to say, if you are already very proficient at handstands, then doing a handstand is a daily behavior and will not give your body the stimulation of being on the verge of making a mistake and needing to correct it.

Huberman believes that the main functional chain of the brain is perception, cognition, emotion, thought, and action. When trying to control our nervous system to perform various tasks (such as learning, solving difficult problems, challenging physical limits), it is difficult for us to control it with our mind (such as constantly telling ourselves not to be distracted). A more feasible method is the "reverse link," starting from our actions, using the operating principles of the nervous system to gradually influence our thoughts, emotions, cognition, and even perception. This is also why Huberman highly recommends various "action tools." Mood follows action.

## The Ideal State for Learning

In addition to the chemical state of neuroplasticity, we also need to pay attention to other factors. For example, we **should not be too relaxed to the point of being drowsy, nor should we be too nervous and excited to be unable to control ourselves to think clearly**. These are also related to the levels of chemicals in our body such as dopamine, adrenaline, acetylcholine, serotonin, and melatonin, which need to be well-regulated. In the previous interview program with Rich Roll, Huberman mentioned a very effective "breathing tool" called the **Physiological Sigh**. The operation method is simply to take two breaths in and then one long breath out. Usually, just one or two physiological sighs are enough to quickly lower our stress and alertness levels, making us feel calmer and improving our learning performance.

The growth mindset mentioned earlier is also very important. When you feel frustrated due to mistakes, you can continuously strengthen your self-suggestion that failure is the only way to help us learn and grow, and it is beneficial to us. This will increase the release of dopamine, enhance learning motivation, and the pleasure in the process.

Regarding the role of sleep in promoting learning, some studies have also provided some related tips:

- Listening to a regular beat while studying and playing the same faint beat while falling asleep can improve the effect of learning and memory.
- Generally, after 90 minutes of study (the period of the human biological clock), you can choose to take a 20-minute break (non-sleep deep rest), which will also enhance the learning effect.
- Gap effect: randomly stopping for 10 seconds during learning. These stops will be "played" at an accelerated speed during sleep, improving the learning effect.

## Improving Focus

The mechanism behind "focus" is the coordination of two "network modes" in the brain. One is called the Default Network, which is activated when we are not doing anything, and the other is called the Task Networks, which are activated when we are focused on doing something. The brains of ordinary people can coordinate these two modes well; they are like a seesaw, when one mode is activated, the other is suppressed. For people with focus disorders (such as ADHD), these two cannot be well coordinated, so they cannot concentrate.

By increasing dopamine levels, the coordination of these two network modes can be effectively promoted. Therefore, there are many ADHD treatment drugs that are related to increasing dopamine, such as **Adderall and Modafinil**. Some surveys show that the abuse of these drugs (often called smart drugs or nootropics) in the United States is even more widespread than marijuana. Many "top students" use them to improve their attention and reduce their need for sleep. However, Professor Huberman said that on the one hand, the increase in dopamine stimulation will bring about a trough in dopamine levels, and on the other hand, these drugs may also lead to addiction, disturb the role of metabolism, and have many negative effects. **They may not improve long-term learning and memory effects**. As mentioned in the previous chapter on dopamine, these drugs should be used with caution, and the frequency of use should be strictly controlled to not be too high.

The best way to improve focus is, of course, to better control our dopamine system as discussed earlier. For example, connect actions with their underlying meaning and give yourself positive psychological suggestions; break down tasks into multiple small milestones and promote the release of dopamine through the motivation of the process itself to improve our focus. In addition, some safe and effective ways to improve focus include:

- Supplementing with an appropriate amount of **Omega-3 EPA fish oil**. This is one of the raw materials for nerve cells and can effectively alleviate depression and help treat ADHD.
- **Releasing movement in other parts of the body can help improve attention**. The example given by the professor is that as a neurologist performing surgery, if he adopts a half-squatting, half-standing posture (releasing movement), the hand holding the scalpel is more stable and less likely to tremble. This reminds me of when I was a student, many of my classmates had the habit of pen spinning. Now that I'm working, many people like to play with fidget spinners or use standing desks, which may have a similar effect.
- **Limiting the field of vision can improve focus**. For example, we are often distracted by the flashing of message notifications on the taskbar. We can enter a "focus mode" through some settings.
- The height of the line of sight also affects the nervous state. **Looking down will make the nervous system tend to be calm, relaxed, and even sleepy, while looking up will make the system more alert**. At work, the monitor should generally be placed at least above the nose level.
- The brain is not good at handling a large number of frequent context switches. A typical example is scrolling through TikTok, where different information is switched frequently at a very fast speed, which is harmful to our attention. A 2014 study showed that **we should spend less than 60 minutes (for teenagers) / 120 minutes (for adults) on our phones every day** to avoid attention deficit problems.
- There is also research showing that **17 minutes of meditation can rewire the neurons in the brain and permanently improve attention**. You only need to do it once, so you can definitely give it a try.

## Brain Health

Finally, let's look at some ways to improve brain health and efficiency.

First, as mentioned earlier, ensure high-quality sleep.

In terms of exercise, **the one that directly helps the brain the most is aerobic exercise**, which improves cardiopulmonary function and supports brain energy supply. It is recommended to have 150-180 minutes of aerobic training per week.

For foods that are good for brain health, the first three points are more important, and the following parts involve less research:

- **Omega-3, especially fatty acids like EPA**, are an important component of the brain, and most people tend to not get enough. Eat more fish, oysters, caviar, chia seeds, walnuts, and soybeans. Consume at least 1.5 grams per day, ideally more than 3 grams. If you don't like to eat fish, you can supplement with fish oil.
- **Phosphatidylserine** also helps with cognitive ability. It can be obtained from fish, meat, and cabbage.
- **Acetylcholine**, an important neuromodulator, improves attention. An important source of choline is eggs, especially the yolk. It is also found in potatoes, nuts, and fruits, although not as rich as in egg yolks. It can be obtained through supplements like Alpha-GPC.
- Creatine, especially for people who don't eat meat, needs to be supplemented at about 5 grams per day.
- Anthocyanins, found in foods like blueberries, blackberries, and grapes. They can reduce DNA damage and alleviate cognitive decline. About 60-120 grams of blueberries need to be supplemented per day.
- Glutamine can be obtained from foods such as beef, chicken, fish, eggs, soybeans, cabbage, spinach, and celery. It improves brain performance under hypoxia (at high altitudes) and can also inhibit the demand for sugar.
- Electrolytes such as water, sodium, potassium, and magnesium are basic elements required for nerve signal transmission and need to be ensured.

This section also discussed the three channels through which our body judges its preference for various foods. The first two are taste judgment and subconscious judgment of nutritional components. The third is more interesting and is also related to dopamine: we can **increase our preference for a certain food by increasing the activity of brain metabolism**. For example, if you don't like to eat fish, one way is to eat fish with your favorite food, and another is to give yourself enough psychological suggestion, convincing yourself that eating fish is good for your health. Through these two methods, you can make your brain release dopamine, thereby gradually increasing your preference for fish.

Finally, if you are interested in dietary supplements, you can also see [what supplements Professor Huberman usually takes](https://www.thorne.com/u/huberman).

# Longevity

Finally, let's look at how to live longer. This is from an interview episode where Huberman talks with an expert in this field, David Sinclair from Harvard.

## The Essence of Aging

Sinclair believes that aging is a disease, and it itself leads to the emergence of many diseases in the usual sense, such as Alzheimer's and cancer. We can "treat" aging through scientific means, and even reverse it.

In essence, aging is the **loss of genetic information**, which is divided into two parts:

- The information of the DNA itself, for example, the DNA structure in cells can be damaged by radiation.
- The information that controls which genes are expressed is damaged, which is the so-called epigenome. This part accounts for 80% of the factors of aging.

There is a natural "aging clock" in the human body, and it does not run at a constant speed. During our growth and development when we are young, this clock runs faster. So if a person develops rapidly during puberty, generally their overall clock runs faster, and their lifespan will be relatively shorter. Isn't that a bit scary... And, generally, shorter people, like dwarfs, rarely get heart disease or cancer, and will also live significantly longer. But don't worry, as mentioned earlier, the information of the gene itself only accounts for 20% of the factors of aging; **the part that controls gene expression accounts for the majority**.

What's a bit surprising here is that the most important experiments introduced by Professor Sinclair are all related to the fasting we mentioned earlier. For example, the lifespan of a mouse is about 2 years. In their laboratory, there was a mouse named Yoda that lived for a full 5 years. The main practices were selecting the dwarf gene and implementing fasting.

The professor explained in detail **why fasting can increase the lifespan of animals/humans by more than 30%**:

- At low blood sugar levels, the body will inhibit the mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) and activate sirtuins, forming a very good chemical state, clearing old proteins, improving insulin sensitivity, providing more energy, repairing cells, etc. This latter sirtuin is an important weapon for us to resist aging.
- When insulin levels are low, "longevity genes" are activated, such as SIRT1.
- Fasting gives cells enough "rest time."
- Low blood sugar levels make the body more sensitive to insulin, absorb blood sugar faster, and is also beneficial to health.
- When you never feel hungry, your aging clock also runs faster.
- In addition to the autophagy triggered by 24-hour cycle fasting, there are deeper cleaning mechanisms that are activated on the second and third days of fasting. Experiments on old mice have shown that this long-term fasting can extend their lifespan by 35%. However, this is a bit difficult for ordinary people to practice.

Sinclair also compared some failed studies from the last century, such as using antioxidants to resist aging. The core idea of modern longevity research is how to **trigger the body's own aging resistance mechanism through some mechanisms**.

In addition, Sinclair also introduced some exciting cutting-edge technologies, such as **restarting our DNA expression system through gene therapy methods**. With a single injection, a blind person can regain their sight, which has been verified in mice. Perhaps in a few years, we can achieve the reversal of aging in various parts of the body like Deadpool.

## Anti-aging Methods

Let's first take a look at the various anti-aging methods.

### Diet

This includes food structure and diet control. As mentioned earlier for diet control, it is recommended to shorten the eating window to about 8 hours. The food structure can refer to this article recently published in Cell: [Nutrition, longevity and disease: From molecular mechanisms to interventions](https://www.cell.com/cell/pdf/S0092-8674\(22\)00398-1.pdf). To summarize briefly, it's about eating more plant-based proteins (peanuts, quinoa, beans, broccoli, etc.), fats (olive oil, nuts, avocados, etc.), and reducing refined carbohydrates (white rice, white bread, cakes, cookies, etc.); animal fats, animal proteins, and sugar are generally accelerating aging.

### Physical Exercise

Aerobic exercise is very helpful for longevity by promoting cardiopulmonary function and vascular health. Strength training can also continuously maintain the strength of our muscles, joints, and ligaments, supporting our protective ability, and reducing the risk of various falls or injuries when we are older. It is generally recommended to have about 3 hours of aerobic exercise per week, combined with 2 to 3 strength training sessions. Aerobic exercise is generally simple; running, cycling, and swimming are all fine. Strength training has a certain threshold, and I am also recently learning some introductory training methods.

### Drugs

There is also a lot of research on drugs, but most of them are still in the early stages of human trials. For details, you can refer to this article published in Nature: [The quest to slow ageing through drug discovery](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41573-020-0067-7), which summarizes various related studies, including the famous metformin, NMN, etc.

### Cell Reprogramming

It has also been mentioned earlier that gene expression is the most important factor affecting aging, so are there any means to control the gene expression of human cells? The famous Yamanaka factors give a possibility. The induction method discovered by the team of Shinya Yamanaka is to transfer four transcription factor genes, Oct4, Sox2, c-Myc, and Klf4, into adult cells through a lentiviral vector, transforming them into pluripotent stem cells (iPS cells) similar to embryonic stem cells. iPS cells have a regenerative capacity similar to embryonic stem cells and can theoretically differentiate into all the organs and tissues of an adult, which perfectly counteracts the aging of the human body caused by cell senescence. Doesn't that sound amazing? Based on these new technologies, many technology innovation companies focusing on the field of longevity have emerged, such as [Life Biosciences](https://www.lifebiosciences.com/) and [Altos Labs](https://altoslabs.com/). We can look forward to the popularization and application of these technologies in the future.

## Practice

Here are some of Sinclair's own practices. If you want to adopt them, you should consider your own situation. What's interesting is that there is a popular comment under this episode that this professor is already 52 years old, but he doesn't look it at all... so you know what I mean.

- He doesn't eat breakfast, and eats very little for lunch, just yogurt or olive oil. For dinner, he mainly eats vegetables, plus fish and shrimp, and basically doesn't eat steak. He doesn't eat sugar, desserts, or bread. He has basically reached the advanced fasting state with a 2-hour eating window. He also occasionally tries not to eat for a whole day, but it's difficult to stick to.
- He takes 1 gram of resveratrol and 1 gram of NMN (which is then converted to NAD, the "fuel" for sirtuins) every day, as well as metformin. He may skip some supplements on days he exercises. He does not take multivitamins.
- The benefits of a vegetable-based diet: it is rich in various nutrients and vitamins; it contains xenohormesis, a substance produced by plants under "stress," which is beneficial for longevity. The latter can also be supplemented with quercetin.
- He generally does aerobic exercise and strength training on alternate days. Aerobic exercise can increase NAD levels.
- He decides on some medications based on his family medical history, for example, he started taking cholesterol-lowering drugs at the age of 29.
- Regarding artificial sweeteners, the professor believes they are generally safe. He also occasionally drinks Diet Coke.

For this series of practices, Professor Sinclair has been experimenting on himself for more than 10 years and uses various means to monitor his body data. By monitoring the data, one can infer a person's "biological age" (not just by looking at their face). Under the above practices, his own biological age has been continuously decreasing and has now reached the level of about 30 years old (his actual age is 52). In addition, he believes that everyone's physical condition is different, and the conventional range of physiological indicators in hospitals may not be suitable for everyone. **In the future, this kind of real-time monitoring of health data and personalized diagnosis will become mainstream**. He gave some examples:

- Monitor blood sugar level HbA1c to observe the effects of fasting, etc.
- Monitor inflammation indicator CRP, which is related to the induction of various diseases such as heart disease.
- Monitor LDL and control it through drugs, etc. Dietary cholesterol has almost no effect on blood cholesterol, so there is no need to avoid red meat, butter, etc.
- Supplementing with iron may accelerate aging. Medical indicators need to be personalized, and low iron content does not necessarily lead to anemia.

There are also some negative factors that affect lifespan:

- Obesity accelerates aging.
- Smoking damages gene expression and accelerates aging.
- The same goes for X-ray examinations; avoid them when they are not necessary.

Looking forward to the future of longevity research, it is still very exciting. Modern science can extend our average lifespan by 1/4 of a year every year. If it can extend our average lifespan by more than 1 year every year, then we have reached the **"longevity escape velocity"** (analogous to flying west at a speed of 1000 miles per hour, the sun will never set), achieving "immortality." The famous futurist Ray Kurzweil predicts that this will be achieved in about 12 years (2034). Let's wait and see.

In addition to this podcast episode, I must also attach the 10k-star project by Wu Chenglin: [Programmer's Guide to Longevity](https://github.com/geekan/HowToLiveLonger).

# Personal Practice

The content introduced earlier is a bit much, and this article is a bit too long. Finally, let me briefly introduce some of the actions and auxiliary tools I have personally adopted.

In terms of sleep, there are no special measures for the time being. With a baby, the quality of sleep at night is generally average. I just try to avoid looking at my phone's light after 11 PM. As for getting light exposure in the morning, I basically get it while walking the dog or commuting by car in the morning, so there's not much pressure. If you are more particular, you can also download the [My Circadian Clock App](https://mycircadianclock.org/) to track your biological clock. It's also a project developed by Satchin Panda and other big names, so it's trustworthy.

In terms of diet, I have started trying the 8-hour eating window fasting, and I feel good so far. For lunch, I generally eat light meals mainly consisting of vegetables. For dinner, I'm more relaxed and eat whatever I want. In the morning, I drink some salt water, tea, or AG1 supplements depending on the situation. For dietary supplements, I am currently only using multivitamins and EPA fish oil. I can refer to [Huberman's "formula"](https://fastlifehacks.com/andrew-huberman-supplements-list/) to add some more later. Huberman himself also said in the show that he is **still in a wait-and-see state for resveratrol and NMN**. I checked some information and found that there are quite a few controversies, so I personally recommend first adopting some widely recognized and used supplements, such as EPA fish oil, metformin, etc. Here is the list of supplements I am currently considering:

- [Basic Nutrients](https://www.thorne.com/products/dp/basic-nutrients-2-day), a regular supplement. You can also choose specific nutrients to supplement according to your own diet structure and living habits.
- [Omega-3 EPA](https://www.thorne.com/products/dp/super-epa-sp608nc), a best-selling supplement for many years. The benefits have been mentioned a lot earlier.
- [AG1](https://athleticgreens.com/en), the super popular "little green powder," with various plant extracts + various vitamins and minerals. It has been mentioned in the programs of Fridman and other big names. I bought it once, but some other reviews seem to say it's not a good value.
- [Betaine HCL & Pepsin](https://www.thorne.com/products/dp/betaine-hcl-pepsin-225-s), to protect the stomach and promote absorption.
- [L-Tyrosine](https://www.thorne.com/products/dp/l-tyrosine), to increase dopamine. I might buy some to try it out.
- [Metformin](https://zh.m.wikipedia.org/zh/%E4%BA%8C%E7%94%B2%E5%8F%8C%E8%83%8D), the "miracle drug" for anti-aging, but its effectiveness and safety are still controversial, so it is recommended to be cautious.
- [ResveraCel](https://www.thorne.com/products/dp/resveracel), an anti-aging combination of resveratrol, NR, etc. The effect is also controversial, especially the NMN part, where various products are mixed and indistinguishable. Purchase with caution.

Many people are concerned that fasting may cause gallstones. Here is some supplementary information:

- From this [paper by Bloch, H. M. et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1419405/), the saturation of bile has a process of first rising and then falling during fasting. [Dr. Berg also explained this](https://youtu.be/2lGuXBwudKw), believing that fasting plus a ketogenic diet (ingesting fat) is actually beneficial for gallbladder health.
- From the results of this [paper by Sichieri, R. et al.](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1405175/), long overnight fasting and dieting will increase the probability of getting gallstones. However, losing weight (reducing fat) itself will increase the probability of getting gallstones.
- There is less research on fasting for more than 24 hours (it's difficult to implement), but mechanistically speaking, long-term fasting should increase the probability of getting gallstones.
- Dietary structure and one's own condition also have a great impact on the formation of gallstones, such as high cholesterol, high insulin levels, and a high-carbohydrate diet. High-fiber foods and healthy fat intake help reduce the probability of getting gallstones.

Overall, I personally feel that there is no definitive conclusion from the experiments in this area (just like with [whether coffee can cause gallstones](https://www.coffeeandhealth.org/factsheet/gallstones-factsheet)), but it should not be a high-probability problem. At least Professor Huberman and another authority in this field, Professor Satchin Panda, have not mentioned this problem. Ideally, you should continuously monitor the medical indicators of your body condition when you are fasting. The rest is up to personal choice :)

In terms of work, study, and focus, it mainly depends on self-discipline. I have good overall control in this area. After understanding the working principle of dopamine, I am even more confident. I mainly use the focus mode of various software to approximate the Pomodoro Technique. In addition, I also use a standing desk and stand for about 30% of the time. During work breaks, I will try Yoga Nidra. In addition, I will use the Books app on my iPad to record my reading time during my study period at night, basically keeping it at more than 30 minutes a day and persisting. Later, I will consider trying to drink yerba mate at work and start trying cold showers in the summer.

In terms of exercise, this is the area with the biggest improvement in the past year. With the urging of the Xiaomi Band's PAI index function, I have basically achieved an average of 3 running or badminton activities per week, continuously keeping the PAI value at around 200. Overall, the improvement in my mental state is still great, and the fat on my stomach has also been reduced a lot. The only thing that bothers me is that I usually exercise after work at 9 or 10 o'clock, and after that, it's close to bedtime, which sometimes affects the quality of sleep.

Finally, there is a lot of other content in Professor Huberman's podcast, such as habit formation, muscle building, coping with fear and trauma, emotional management, etc. Interested friends can explore further. This article is mainly based on the statement of experimental facts and theoretical assumptions. All the above action plans need to be implemented under the guidance of a physician and professionals, combined with your own situation. Pay attention to your own safety. Neither I nor Huberman are responsible for the relevant consequences.
